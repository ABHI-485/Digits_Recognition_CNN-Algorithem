# Digits_Recognition_CNN-Algorithm

Digit Recognition using CNN Algorithm
Introduction
The Digit Recognition using CNN Algorithm project is designed to identify handwritten digits (0â€“9) with high accuracy. Leveraging the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), this project efficiently processes image data and performs digit classification. The widely-known MNIST dataset is used for training and testing the model.

# Features:

>Utilizes CNN architecture for feature extraction and classification.

>Achieves high accuracy on handwritten digit recognition tasks.

>Provides visualization of the training process and predictions.

>Saves trained model for reuse.

# Prerequisites:

Ensure you have the following installed before proceeding:

Python 3.x \
TensorFlow or Keras \
NumPy \
Matplotlib \
Jupyter Notebook (optional, for interactive development) 

# Model Architecture:
Input Layer: Accepts 28x28 grayscale images.\
Convolutional Layers: Extract spatial features from the images.\
Pooling Layers: Reduce the feature map size while retaining important information.\
Fully Connected Layers: Map the features into class probabilities.\


# Output:
The trained model demonstrates an accuracy of approximately 98% on the MNIST test dataset. Visualization of predictions confirms its robustness in recognizing a variety of handwritten digits.
